I will implement the Church Parity features (Home Block + Switcher) as per PRD-04.

### 1. **Component: `ChurchPicker`**
- Create `apps/web/src/components/church/church-picker.tsx`.
- Implement a modal/dialog using Shadcn UI (or similar existing UI).
- Features: Search input, List of Churches, Selection logic.
- Logic: Updates `users.church_id` via Supabase client.

### 2. **Component: `MyChurchBlock` (Home Widget)**
- Create `apps/web/src/components/home/my-church-block.tsx`.
- Logic:
    - Fetches user's `church_id`.
    - If empty: Shows "Select Church" state with `ChurchPicker`.
    - If set: Shows Church details (Name, Logo) + 3 latest posts.
    - Includes "Change Church" button.

### 3. **Page Integration**
- Update `apps/web/src/app/(protected)/app/page.tsx`:
    - Insert `MyChurchBlock` at the top (or appropriate location) of the dashboard.
- Update `apps/web/src/app/(protected)/app/church/page.tsx`:
    - Add "Trocar Igreja" button in the header/actions area.

### 4. **Data Fetching**
- Ensure `MyChurchBlock` fetches `church_posts` with the correct filters (`published`, `pinned`, limit 3).

### 5. **Verification**
- Verify Home shows the block.
- Verify Church Picker works (search + selection).
- Verify "Change Church" updates the UI and persists.
