I will implement the missing Church features in the Web App to match the React Native App's functionality, focusing on "My Church", Feed, and Quick Actions, without modifying the database schema.

### 1. **Route Structure Implementation**
- Create `apps/web/src/app/(protected)/app/church/page.tsx`: The main "Minha Igreja" page.
- Create `apps/web/src/app/(protected)/app/church/posts/[id]/page.tsx`: The specific post detail page.

### 2. **Component Creation**
- **`ChurchHeader`**: To display the church's logo, name, and location.
- **`QuickActions`**: To fetch and display `church_quick_actions` (e.g., Donate, Website).
- **`ChurchFeed`**: To fetch and list `church_posts` (pinned posts first).
- **`PostCard`**: A card component for individual feed items.
- **`PostDetail`**: A full view for the post content.

### 3. **Profile Integration**
- Review and update `apps/web/src/components/profile/profile-form.tsx` to ensure it correctly displays the linked church.
- If `church_id` is editable, allow selection (or show a read-only view if restricted).

### 4. **Data Fetching & Logic**
- Use Supabase client to fetch data from `churches`, `church_posts`, and `church_quick_actions`.
- Handle cases where the user has no `church_id` (Empty State).
- Ensure strictly read-only access where appropriate (as per PRD).

### 5. **Verification**
- Verify that the `/app/church` route works.
- Verify that the feed loads correctly for a user with a valid `church_id`.
- Verify the empty state for users without a church.
